# Infra Toolkit

This project is a collection of scripts and documentation (playbooks) to help set up and manage a local homelab infrastructure for personal projects.

## Purpose

The goal is to make it easy to bootstrap, automate, and document the setup of a home lab environment, supporting experimentation, learning, and building real-world solutions at home.

## What's Inside

- **Scripts:** Automation for provisioning, configuration, and maintenance tasks.
- **Docs & Playbooks:** Step-by-step guides and notes for repeatable infrastructure operations.

## Background

This toolkit is part of a broader journey to document and share the process of building and running a personal homelab, as described in related blog posts and drafts. The project will evolve as new tools, scripts, and playbooks are added.

## Getting Started

Stay tuned! Initial scripts and docs will be added soon.
