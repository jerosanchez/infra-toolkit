# Markdown content

To ensure that AI-generated markdown content passes linting checks (e.g. `markdownlint`), follow these guidelines:

- Surround lists with blank lines.
- Add blank lines before and after headings.
- Do not break paragraphs in lines (line length is ignored by the linter).
- Use proper indentation for nested lists and code blocks.
- Use fenced code blocks (triple backticks) for code snippets.
- Always specify the code type (language) in fenced code blocks (e.g., `bash`, `python`).
- For generic (no language) fenced code blocks, use `text`.
- Avoid trailing spaces at the end of lines.
- End files with a single newline.
- Use consistent heading levels and formatting.
